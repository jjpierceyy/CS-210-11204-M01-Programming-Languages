Project Three

Summary:
This program is designed for a grocery store to track the frequency of various items purchased. It reads item data from an input file, allows the user to query the frequency of specific items, displays a list of all items with their frequencies, prints a histogram of item frequencies, and saves the frequency data to a backup file. The program is implemented using C++ and utilizes classes, maps, and file I/O.

I enjoyed researching and creating this project using knowledge obtained from CS210

I could improve this code by improving the output formatting and utilizing a SQL database.

The most challenging piece of code was reading and writing from a file. I overcame this with online resources such as StackOverflow and Youtube.

The syntax, formatting, and inline comments will be particularly transferable to other projects down the road. 

I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by following the syntax learned from the CS210 course and using as many inline comments as possible.

Thank you!
